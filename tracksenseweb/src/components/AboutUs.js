            <p>My grandfather worked for Erie Lackawanna RR. He always took me to the yard for rides in yard or on local train to serve customers on the line. Since then I always enjoying watching trains to go by and keep memories of my grandfather. My inspiration of this project to able know where the trains are, just the same way with other people and their radios. This will help to overcome the barrier. I hope this will become successfully with railfan community, especially for other deaf railfans. Hopefully this will expand out to another states</p>
